# PT elections

This repository contains the source code that produces a dataset of the most recent portuguese elections.

You can find its specification and instructions on how to use the dataset here: [specification.md](specification.md).

## How to develop

This project uses Rust for downloading and storing the data, and DuckDB/SQL/Python for analysis and agregations.
